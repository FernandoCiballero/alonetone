## What the heck is alonetone?

alonetone is a place for small label, DIY, bedroom and other musicians and bands to upload and share their mp3s for free. We've been around since 2008.

If you make music (and own the rights to it) then this site is built for you.


## Why alonetone instead of cool service XYZ?

Most of the 'free' services where you can host your music run ads, are funded by investors or flat out owned by media conglomerates. In general, they are hoping to make money off of your "content"...erm...music.

Music communities tend to be overly obsessed with genres and popularity and contests â€” we're not into that!

alonetone was started to provide a non-commercial alternative. Something useful, something different, something that the musicians can feel like they own.

Beyond that, we want to do it right. Clean, only the essentials. Not too dorked-out. Easy to get around. [Read more here](/about/why-i-built-alonetone).


## Wow, no company! So who makes alonetone?

alonetone is conceived and built by [Sudara](/sudara).

[montgomeru](/montgomeru) handles frontend coding.

We get regular design love from Samo.

After our initial launch in 2008 most features were inspired, recommended by, and build to please alonetoners who spoke up and helped by providing their valuable feedback in chat and the forums.


## How long will it be free?

The ability to upload and share music without ads or payment will exist as long as alonetone exists.

## Is alonetone open source?

Yup! We are open-minded to contributions at [github](http://github.com/sudara/alonetone).

Thanks to the nice people at [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) and [Skylight](https://skylight.io) for providing their services free for open source projects.
